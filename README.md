# Pitch-Scores-Task
Pitch Scores Task assuming the task involves evaluating startup pitch text and generating quality scores using NLP.
# ðŸš€ Startup Pitch Text Evaluation with NLP

This project was built as part of the AI Intern application task for **ScaleDux**. It focuses on analyzing startup pitch texts (typically from pitch decks) and automatically scoring them across key startup dimensions using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## ðŸ§  Objective

The goal is to extract meaningful signals from a startupâ€™s pitch text and score it across multiple criteria such as:

- **Problem Clarity**
- **Market Understanding**
- **Traction**
- **Team Strength**
- **Vision**
- **Business Model**
- **Overall Quality Score**

These scores help quantify the effectiveness of a startupâ€™s pitch using AI-powered evaluation techniques.
